# HeyDay-bonus

# Welcome to Hey Day!

**Hey Day** is a tradition at Auburn University that allows students to connect with other students who they would otherwise never have talked to. 
Students and faculty wear name tags all day, so that when they pass others they can greet them with a *Hey _____!* There is also a celebration on the 
campus greenspace during the day that includes free food, vendors like flower trucks and treats, games, and a pep rally!
